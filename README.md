Phosphor Deck
=============

In the old days, screens were illuminated by electron-beams hitting a phosphoric layer.
Early screens were glowing green, later some were glowing amber/orange. All of them were - especially compared
to todays mess on a screen - relatively disZZtraction-free. Ok, that was mainly because there was not
a lot of space on a screen: 80x24 characters.

The term deck is taken from some cyberpunk novels like Burning Chrome or the Shadowrun series. It just
describes a means to enter rsp. connect to the grid, matrix, cyberspace, cloud, internet ... whatever
name it is that you prefer. And this is what Phosphor is: the client-software and operating system for
such a deck. Plus some local stuff, maybe. Your hardware ... well ... that's your own choice.

Intention
=========

I want to revive some of the virtues of old times: work distraction free, concentrate
on your work's content and don't waste time. Make a clear statement: it works like this!

And because I have nostalgic memories of those times, some classic design will probably not hurt.

Today's swamps
==============

Try to create a workstation for real work. Try with Windows: tons of tools needed,
hours of installation, hours of system updates and by then it doesn't even look good or
works flawlessly or ... at all. And just one mistake and you start over from scratch. An install
takes hours sometimes days to complete. 

Oh yes, I believe a MacOS is a much better place to be, starting with its ingenious backup-system,
then the app-store and other goodies. Then again, the mere existence of homebrew makes clear:
it is not complete. And for some of us, the move towards ARM-CPUs created a host of problems.
And I won't go in length complaining about their prices in recent years.

Then there is Linux. Try a distribution: even those dedicated towards specific use-cases often
do half the job or lose their momentum in fundamentalistic discussions. Especially the professional
distributions try to stay generic, thus avoiding any clear decision. While again, there is no solution
in this. Plain distros do not solve problems, they actually sort, prioritize and order problems, but
a really working solution has yet to rise from the masses of trash.

Rise! Rice! Ricing! Do you know the term? "Ricing" has become a kind of sports amoungst Linux-enthusiasts.
It is a kind of competition for the most thrilling and practical desktop environments. Now, some of these
simply are breath-taking. They are a way to express individualism and boast with their creator's 
skills. For those who want to take a look: search for 'r/unixporn' on Reddit or Google.
The problem with ricing is: it is individual. Manually crafted. Nothing to be used with e.g. my 7 notebooks and
8 desktop-workstations. I'd be busy all day configuring the notebook that I messed yesterday ... every day.

Become real and make a statement
================================

Nonetheless, I like that ricing-movement. It lays the path for what I want to do. 
What is missing is a way to go from the individual setup to some replicatable design.
Now, I am an Ansible-fan. Bringing a ricing for a mainstream Linux distribution into
an Ansible-playbook sounds like a promising idea. So where am I heading?

I want to create a workstation. It shall be ok for IT consultancy work. Thus:

  - virtualisation and containers
  - scripting
  - content-creation (at first for video-blogging, but who knows?)
  - ... whatever comes to my mind

I tried a few progressive Linux-distributions as a basis for my work ... tried and failed, so I reverted to Ubuntu.
That one, I know quite good ... at least I believe so.

Avoid busy work
===============

I do not need X versions of each class of application, this setup will make decisions. Well,
I will make them. You want another application than what is in here? Be my guest and clone and
maintain your own version of this setup!

Go the cloud-way
================

In MacOS you install pretty much manually and keep things alive with the Time-Machine-Backup.
While this basically works, it is still not optimal. I learned this the hard way and thus
I needed another approach. Time-Machine is ... undisputedly ... great. But I prefer to build
a vanilla systems and bring it up to speed without effort.

I try to got the cloud way: do not repair ... destroy and rebuild. As such, I assume a vanilla install
of Ubuntu Linux 22.04 (yes, choice #1) and configure this with an Ansible-playbook (yup, choice #2).

The desktop-environment
=======================

I wanted a tiling window-manager. The Regolith-desktop-environment looked like a great choice (#3, btw. ;-)).
Over the time, I will customise a few things.

The first thing: I will switch to alacritty as terminal emulator. There are many reasons for this. 
My most immediate one is: it does not require a lot of customization and if I want to customize I can
do so with a simple config file.

All this dconf central config management is probably nice, but it is a pain in the ..., if you want
to manage configuration with a tool like Ansible.

The command-line
================

Look at the distributions: the most modern they come up with the the standard GNU scope of tools.
An the BASH as shell. Apple just switched to zsh, which is a documentation nightmare. Some distros
did the same. Guys there is way more: tons of command-line tools to make life easier and not a single
distro that I know installs these upfront? Why not? I got no idea, really.

I will offer bash as shell for scripting, but interactively I will use fish. Never heard of that?
Relax! You will like it! Trust me that far! Fish is the friendly-interactive-shell. It makes things
easier.

Apart from this little heretic choice of shells, I will bring in a host of CLI tools that are meant to
make your life easier. Just, they will only help you if you know then, so I fear I will have to create 
quite some documentation pointing to sources where you can learn about the one or the other tool that
the playbook installs for you.

Applications
============

Apart from tools, a couple of applications will come with the deck ...

Virtualisation and Configuration
--------------------------------

  - Virtualbox
  - Vagrant
  - Packer
  - Ansible

Development
-----------

  - VScode
  - GIT
  - Python
  - TCL/Tk

Any development going further than this will likely profit from using a VM configured accordingly. This is for e.g. PHP/Laravel,
Google Go, Rust. Remember that with a Vagrant in VMs you have a shared directory, so you can manage the source
directly on the host and edit with Visual Studio Code or nvim.

Too much software for you? C'mon! What you do not need, you might just ignore. Don't tell me that you care about a few GB more or less on your disk!

Content Creation
----------------

  - OBS Studio
  - ...

I intend to have a complete suite to create Content for youtube e.g. as a vlog or training-video or alike. OBS Studio is also a good basis for any kind of video conference.

Browser:
  - Google Chrome
  - Firefox

Office and Communication:

  - Slack
  - Thunderbird
  - Libre-Office

Snaps
-----

Using snap to deploy software has disadvantages: e.g. bigger memory footprint, longer latency to run an application, etc. pp. . But it has the undoubted advantage to not clutter the system with files and remains, whatever.

Therefore: if you want to add things to a Phosphor setup, you might take a close look at snap.

I can hear you! Many professionals object against snaps. Snaps tend to polarise the community. For my own part, I like them, because
they solve problems I run into, eveventually. Nevertheless I also see the disadvantages: snaps getting actualized without explicit
request by the admin, extended startup latencies of apps, etc.. I do not want to join into this discussion. I use snaps where I think
that they are of good use. I do not care about the pros and cons as long as a snap solves more problems than it creates.

Where is this going?
--------------------

I will continue writing this playbook. If others want to add in work, do so! I do intend to go this way: my Playbook will be the basics. If someone wants to add own elements, prefer to create a role named phosphor-something in the Ansible-Galaxy, so people can quickly integrate these features to their setup.

Changes to the core-playbook of Phosphor? Please just write an email! For the time being I do not intend to implement a complex workflow on git.

One day, playbooks like this might be part of a distro's install?! Then all you need to configure is a git-repo and the distro's-installer uses it to fine tune the basics. That would be cool. Until then, running Ansible is easy enough for a start.

About dconf and such
--------------------

I try to avoid dconf. Simply because I did not find a good way to handle such configuration. If someone could point me to an intro how to
handle this with Ansible or alike tool, I might become a fan of it.

I may be a relic from the last century, but for me there is still no better way for configuration than a good old config file.
Show me a good way to configure via dconf using ansible or an alike tool and I change my mind! So far I found nothing fancy.

As a consequence the selection of components for the Phosphor Deck is somewhat tied to the way an application handles its configuration.
