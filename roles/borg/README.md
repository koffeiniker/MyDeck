Borg
====

Borg is probably the most interesting backup solution for Linux.

Borgmatic
---------

This tool configures backups with all relevant parameters in yaml files.
This makes a backup way more understandable than a large amount of command line arguments for borg.

TODO
====

I still need to add some arguments and proposals for backup to the deck.

I should install borgmatic via pip to have a newer version.
