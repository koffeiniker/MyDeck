# At first let us have a look at the interactive shell.
# Interactively, fish is far superior in handling to bash.
# Ok this would not make me write a single shell-script in
# fish's flavour of shell-script, but as the terminal-shell
# it is clearly the better choice.
#
# For those who follow Apple in preferring the zsh:
# you got my respect, maybe later I will prepare a separate
# role for you.
